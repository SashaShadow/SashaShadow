- 👋 Hi, I’m @SashaShadow
- 👀 I’m interested in playing music, I have a band where I am the bassist. I am also a music therapist and a mental health worker.
  I am getting into coding and I want to have a job where I can show my skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Node.js and backend programming (Coderhouse). I have experience in front-end library React.js, building different applications.
      I am also watching other Wes Bos courses (CSS Grid, etc).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any front-end project that will come up.
